# Initial release verification

Verification date: 2026-09-19

## Automated checks

The following checks passed from a clean local clone with isolated writable Go build and module caches at commit `172e90e`:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Formatting, unit tests, race tests, vet, and local build (`just check`) | Passed |
| Linux amd64 build | Passed |
| macOS amd64 build | Passed |
| Windows amd64 build | Passed |
| Pinned module verification (`go mod verify`) | Passed |

The clean module cache resolved only the versions pinned by `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

## Runtime verification

| Platform | Native credential store | Real OIDC and delegated read | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | Passed against the active profile through GNOME Keyring Secret Service | OIDC login and a delegated `sys/health` read passed | Passed |
| macOS | Not run | Not run | Unverified |
| Windows | Not run | Not run | Unverified |

The Linux config directory and file use `0700` and `0600` permissions. The official Vault CLI is installed. The native credential probe read the active profile entry successfully without exposing a profile name, endpoint, token, or keyring value. The initial unavailable-or-locked result came from a sandboxed probe and was discarded. A check outside the sandbox confirmed that Secret Service is available and `vlt` can read its credential.

After VPN connection, the configured Vault health endpoint returned an HTTP response. The active credential was invalid or expired, so `vlt` completed OIDC and replaced the profile token in GNOME Keyring. A delegated `vlt read -format=json sys/health` then succeeded. The read did not change the refreshed token, and the token did not appear in profile configuration, captured standard output, or captured standard error. No raw Vault response or credential was written to this document.

Cross-compilation does not certify macOS or Windows runtime behavior.
